## AUTHETICATION

Auth0 Integration with Passport.js
Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

Node.js and npm installed on your system.
An Auth0 account. You can sign up for a free account [here](https://auth0.com/signup)
Google Developer Console project with OAuth 2.0 credentials.

####Configure Passport.js with Auth0 and Google strategy using the provided code snippet.

```javascript
const passport = require("passport");
const GoogleStrategy = require("passport-google-oauth").OAuth2Strategy;
const {
	GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
	GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
} = require("../config/constants");

passport.serializeUser(function (user, cb) {
	cb(null, user);
});

passport.deserializeUser(function (obj, cb) {
	cb(null, obj);
});

passport.use(
	new GoogleStrategy(
		{
			clientID: GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
			clientSecret: GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
			callbackURL: "http://localhost:8080/api/auth/google/callback",
		},
		function (accessToken, refreshToken, profile, done) {
			userProfile = profile;
			return done(null, userProfile);
		}
	)
);

module.exports = passport;
```

Update the GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET constants in your application with the credentials obtained in step 1.

Usage
Initialize Passport.js in your Express application

```javascript
const passport = require("./src/authentication/passport");
const session = require("express-session");
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.use(
	session({
		resave: false,
		saveUninitialized: true,
		secret: "SECRET",
	})
);

app.use(passport.initialize());
app.use(passport.session());
```

##Create Route For Authetification

```javascript
const router = require("express").Router();
const passport = require("../authentication/passport");

router.get(
	"/google",
	passport.authenticate("google", { scope: ["profile", "email"] })
);

router.get(
	"/google/callback",
	passport.authenticate("google", { failureRedirect: "/error" }),
	(req, res) => {
		// Successful authentication,
		const user = req.user;
		res.status(200).json({ message: "success" });
	}
);

module.exports = router;
```
